            "So as my resume says, I attended a course about web development mid 2020, and I've learned most of my skills as a React.js developper back then. I can say that I'm a Javascript developper because it is my first real langage (I've started with Python wich I like but I only used it in simple algorythm exercises). After that I was in internship in a company for 2 months were I improve my knowledge and my way of coding and since then I'm on my own, working on a project that I intend to finish and I keep learning and improving myself every day. I made this portfolio with Next.js just to challenge myself. Thanks for reading",
